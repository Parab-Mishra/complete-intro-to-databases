"/terminology","Terminology","1C","Brian discusses what databases are, what the various type we will cover, and get you in the mindset of storing data.","Welcome"
"/nosql","NoSQL","2A","Brian introduces the first style of database in the course, NoSQL. He goes over what the term means and leads into the example NoSQL you are going to work with, MongoDB.","NoSQL"
"/mongodb","MongoDB","2B","MongoDB is a document-based NoSQL database that allows developers to write unstructured data to be queried later. Brian goes into what this means for a developer and when you might want to use it","NoSQL"
"/querying-mongodb","Querying MongoDB","2C","After inserting documents into MongoDB, you are going to want to be able to query those documents. Brian shows you how in this section to write find queries for MongoDB.","NoSQL"
"/updating-mongodb","Updating MongoDB","2D","Brian shows you how to update and delete the documents that have been inserted into the database.","NoSQL"

"/mongodb-ops","MongoDB Ops","2H","While developers don't necessarily need to know how to run a database cluster in production, it can be important to know how and why databases are being run the way they are. Brian gives a brief treatise on the various features of MongoDB's operations aspects.","NoSQL"
